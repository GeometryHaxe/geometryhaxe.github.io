# Geometry Haxe
Geometry Haxe is a fan recreation of Geometry Dash, written in Haxe.

Geometry Haxe is my attempt at recreating Geometry Dash in a programming language I am properly familiar with. Based off the actual source code of Geometry Dash, Geometry Haxe aims to be a better Geometry Dash for everybody. No servers though. :(
